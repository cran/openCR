version 1.3.0 (2018-11-26)

New features and changed behaviour
    o canned predictors for learned responses (b, bk etc.) redefined and extended
    o AIC method acquires argument n to override the default effective sample size
    o openCR.fit() no longer computes 'posterior' component for mixture models
    o classMembership method for finite mixture models ('posterior' component removed)
    o specifying native R routines for the likelihood forces ncores = 1
    o print and AIC methods for summary.openCR
    o openCR.fit() acquires argument dframe0 for pesky custom models with learned response
    o par.openCR.fit() default trace = FALSE 
    o rev method for reversing primary sessions of capthist objects

Bugs fixed
    o varying usage unreliable with 'multi' detector type in some circumstances
    o summary method for openCR objects: erroneous counts in capthist component (ignored freq)
    o finite mixture model posterior class membership crashed openCR.fit() for spatial models
    o finite mixture models failed for 'multi' detector type

Other
    o help page for openCR.design corrected

version 1.2.1 (2018-10-31)

New features and changed behaviour
    o runsim.spatial() acquires intervals argument
    o summary method for openCR objects 
    o sumsims() accepts output from summary.openCR
    o sumsims() acquires argument 'true' and adds summaries of bias, coverage etc.
    o CJSp1 = TRUE details argument respected by openCR.design etc.

Bugs fixed
    o sumsims() failed with parameters superN and superD
    o derived method for openCR objects: erroneous f and lambda for some models when
      intervals not 1.0
    o print.derivedopenCR did not apply Dscale to session-specific D

Other
    o changed default starting value for superD
    o tweaks to print method for derivedopenCR class
    o not published on CRAN

version 1.2.0 (2018-05-25)

New features and changed behaviour
    o  multithreaded execution of some functions (up to 4x speed gain)
    o  openCR.fit() types 'secrCL' and 'secrD' emulate closed-population analyses of 'secr'
    o  openCR.fit() trace may be a positive integer (frequency of reporting)
    o  ucare.cjs() wrapper for R2ucare test functions
    o  moving.fit() and extractFocal() functions for moving window of sessions
    o  m.array() reports releases on final session (last.session = TRUE)
    o  openCR.fit() details ignoreusage option
    o  runsim.spatial() and runsim.nonspatial() ncores argument defaults to NULL for multithreading
    o  cyclic.fit() exposed as internal function but not exported
    o  derived() method for openCR objects acquires arguments newdata and all.levels

Bugs fixed
    o usage of count detectors not properly accounted for (noted by Richard Glennie)
    o fixedbeta clashed with start argument (some options)
    o session covariates not matched correctly with robust design sessions
    o LLonly reported x -1
    o details$hessian = FALSE failed

Other
    o Links to RcppParallel
    o Additional check for nonidentifiable parameters in print.openCR()
